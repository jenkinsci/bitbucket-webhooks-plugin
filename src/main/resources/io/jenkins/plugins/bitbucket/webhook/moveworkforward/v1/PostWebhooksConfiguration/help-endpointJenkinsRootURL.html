    You can customize the Jenkins Server Root URL to be used by this Bitbucket endpoint,
    instead of the one set in Jenkins global configuration. This may be useful in local
    networks with different DNS views for different clients (such as a Bitbucket server)
    or to receive webhooks through some tunneling or relaying service hosted elsewhere.
